First, build thrift from source. Make sure you dont have it installed via homebrew.
As of 0.9.1 it will generate incorrect Go code, at least for me.

Install thrift Go lib:

    go get -v github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift

Then build the compiler from tip. I have found that 0.9.1 compiler does not generate working Go code for me

   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/apache/thrift
   ./configure
   cd compiler/cpp && make && cp -v thrift $GOHOME/bin/thrift-1.0

Then, to generate the thrift stubs, run:

   thrift-1.0 --gen go:thrift_import=github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift,package=multiply --out . multiply.thrift

Finally, you should be able to build the server in the server dir.
